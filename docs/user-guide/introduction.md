# Introduction

## Purpose of the Project

The `pan-os-duplicate-finder` tool is designed to help network administrators identify and manage duplicate address objects across PAN-OS device groups. Whether you're cleaning up configurations, consolidating objects, or auditing your setup, this tool streamlines the process of finding redundant address objects.

## Problem Statement

Managing address objects across multiple device groups can lead to unintentional duplication. These duplicates can:
- Make configuration management more difficult
- Increase the risk of inconsistencies
- Complicate troubleshooting
- Make changes more time-consuming

`pan-os-duplicate-finder` addresses these challenges by automatically identifying duplicate objects and providing detailed reports about their locations and relationships.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Scanning**: Examines both shared space and all device groups
- **Multiple Object Types**: Supports ip-netmask, ip-range, and FQDN objects
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates CSV reports with complete object information
- **Rich Console Output**: Provides clear, colorized summaries and progress indicators
- **Secure Authentication**: Supports both interactive and file-based credentials
- **Flexible Configuration**: Supports runtime arguments or settings file

## Workflow

1. **Authentication**: Connect to your PAN-OS device using your credentials
2. **Discovery**: Scan all device groups and shared space for address objects
3. **Analysis**: Identify objects with matching values across different locations
4. **Reporting**: Generate detailed CSV reports and console summaries

## Benefits

- **Time Saving**: Quickly identify duplicate objects without manual searching
- **Error Prevention**: Find inconsistencies before they cause problems
- **Better Organization**: Help maintain cleaner, more efficient configurations
- **Audit Ready**: Generate reports for configuration audits
- **Easy Integration**: Command-line interface works well with scripts and automation
